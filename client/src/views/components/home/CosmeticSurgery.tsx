                        Plastic surgery is a surgical specialty involving the
                        restoration, reconstruction, or alteration of the human
                        body. It can be divided into two main categories:
                        reconstructive surgery and cosmetic surgery.
                        Reconstructive surgery includes craniofacial surgery,
                        hand surgery, microsurgery, and the treatment of burns.

                        Surgeons can reshape the appearance of body parts
                        through cosmetic surgery. Some of the most common body
                        parts people want to improve through surgery include:

                        Breasts: Increase or reduce the size of breasts or

                        The procedures, techniques, and principles of cosmetic
                        surgery are entirely focused on enhancing a patientâ€™s
                        appearance. Improving aesthetic appeal, symmetry, and
                        proportion are the key goals. An aesthetic surgery can
                        be performed on all areas of the head, neck, and body.
                        Since cosmetic procedures treat areas that function
                        properly, cosmetic surgery is designated as elective.
                        Cosmetic elective procedures are performed by doctors
                        from a variety of medical fields, including plastic
                        surgeons.
